Hi Aditya,

We have checked from our end and found that the TTs listed under point 2, where the alarm was cleared, had a time difference of more than 30 minutes.

Additionally, the TTs under point 3 were manually resolved by user in wfm portal. And the reason for the time difference is when we select event end date , the event end date we can select back date time from 
current time but greater than event_start_date which feature is enable currently in out wfm ticketing portal. For this reason the time difference of more than 30 minutes while resolving TT manually.

So to restrict the back date time selecttion, we will discuss with sajid sir for the changes. we will let you know after the changes have done.
